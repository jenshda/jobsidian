# Main.js

In the `main.js` file, you would need to define the main functionality of your plugin. Here is an example of what your main.js file could look like:

```javascript
// Import the obsidian module
const { Plugin } = require('obsidian');

// Define the main plugin class
class MyPlugin extends Plugin {
  
  // On load function
  async onload() {
    console.log('Loading MyPlugin');

    // Register a command
    this.addCommand({
      id: 'my-plugin-command',
      name: 'My Plugin Command',
      callback: () => {
        console.log('My plugin command was executed');
      }
    });

    // Register an event listener
    this.registerEvent(this.app.workspace.on('file-open', (file) => {
      console.log(`File ${file.name} was opened`);
    }));
  }

  // On unload function
  onunload() {
    console.log('Unloading MyPlugin');
  }
}

// Export the plugin class
module.exports = MyPlugin;

```

In this example, we first import the `Plugin` class from the `obsidian` module. We then define a new class `MyPlugin` that extends `Plugin`.

In the `onload` method of the class, we add a new command with an ID of `my-plugin-command` and a name of `My Plugin Command`. The command's callback function logs a message to the console.

We also register an event listener that logs a message to the console when a file is opened in the workspace.

In the `onunload` method, we log a message to the console to indicate that the plugin is being unloaded.

Finally, we export the `MyPlugin` class so that it can be used by the Obsidian application.

This is just a basic example, and you can customize your plugin's functionality by adding more commands, event listeners, and other features as needed.
